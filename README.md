# Creative Coding: An Intro to Creative Coding
2 Metrotech Center Room 811
7:00 - 9:50pm Monday

#### Syllabus is subject to change at any time. Check back regularly.

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no programming experience, who are interested in creating interactivity.  Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result.  In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking - to think concurrently and modularly.  By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for creating interactivity including: event-driven creative applications, interactive installations,  graphical user interfaces, games and user interfaces.  Interactivity will be introduced and discussed throughout.


## IDM Program Objectives
Students will:

* Develop   **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities in art and design.

* Develop   **technical skills** to realize their ideas.

* Develop   **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

* Gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

* Develop   **collaboration skills** to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

## Course Objectives
Students in this course will:

• Understand the basics of creative coding in Java & Javascript (Processing/p5.js). <br>
• Write code within the context of visual art + design, to realize unique ideas and to enhance concepts, demonstrating new powers of expression and the incorporation of time. <br>
• Apply their understanding of digital media to software. <br>
• Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real time framework. <br>
• Experiment with different techniques for user input and output, including sensors and non-traditional screens. <br>
• Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project. <br>

## Course Prerequisites
This class assumes a high degree of computer literacy, but not a high degree of programming ability. We will be learning computer programing in a platform-generic way, however all examples will be demonstrated in Java or Javascript using the library p5.js (p5js.org) or Processing.  Having previous coding experience in Javascript, Java, C++, or Python is a plus, but not necessarily a must.

Some students will have experience in programming. Some will not. With the consulation of the student and their experience, the weight of the first two learning objects will be determined. For example, if you have experience writing code, you will be pushed to achieve objective #2 with a greater weight than objective #1. If you have a bit of experience programming, but not a lot, you will be pushed to achieve objective 1 and 2 equally, etc. After the third week of this course, this will be determined between the student and the professor on indiviual basis. 

## Assessment
Assessment will occur by reviewing weekly coding assignments & challenges, project milestones, and final projects. The course is cumulative.  Please see the Grading Section for specific grade breakdown, calendar for due dates, and assignments for briefs. 

The assignments are your opportunity to put your skills to the test. They're designed to test and deepen your knowledge while giving me valuable information about how you're progressing in the class. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRtV-ugIT0k">Finished is better than perfect. </a> An attempt at them is better than nothing at all. 


This course is looking at how well you understand and utilize programming concepts to make visual materials. 
Your grades given across the objectives, with your current objective path in mind, considering the place in time we are at within the semester. For example in the beginning of the semester, someone that is a proficient programming without any visual or creative experience will have more weight of their grade on how much they are pushing themselves to make creative and dynamic visual materials. While those that have no experience in programming, will have a weight distribution between both aspects, ex 70% programming fundamentals and usage of them, 30% creative exploration of visual materials. Later on in the semester, those weight distribution will shift to a 70% creativity exploration and dynamic materials, 30% on programming fundamentals.

As a result, 2 students cannot compare their grades. Each student is at a different point in their development. Each student is looked at individually, with relation to their progress, leaps in development, creativity, exploration, research and risk-taking. If you are unhappy with your grade, you need to be making more effort towards your progress. A "C" grade means average, making average progress. "B" is above average progress and work. "A" means superior work.

Students will evaluate their own progressed in a course in two ways: 1) A course evaluation form, which will be developed based on the course’s individual objectives. 2) Students will participate in a self reflection assignment due Week 7  & Week 15   or as otherwise noted. This written evaluation is worth 15 points and to be turned into me as a separate document.

• Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result. 

• Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.

Week 15 only:  <br>
• Compare and contrast the Object Orientated Programming style versus Procedural Programming style not simply in definition, but rather your own understanding of each as well as your usage/fluidity with each.

## Course Requirements
• Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many, etc) ONLY. If your email is longer than 3 sentences you need to...

• Talk to me in person about issues or problems

• Consult the github account for the class at twice a week for up to date information and demo code

• Come to class on time and be familiar with the current class topics, and be ready to answer or ask questions and participate in discussions

• Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave

• Be professional at all times in your communication and attitude

• Complete all assignments by due date

• Acquire and keep up with all of the readings and assigned videos. Read all assigned readings before class. Watch all the videos.

• Devote at a minimum 8 to 12 hours a week OUTSIDE of class, fulfilling homework assignments, readings and studying concepts covered in class, in order to do average.

• Have Desire amounting to Enthusiasm (to Learn and to Explore)

• Have Patience, Persistence, and Discipline

• Be Creative. Experiment

• Pay attention to Detail & Craft

• Have Self-confidence and Pride in your work

• Take Risks & be Fearless in your assignments

• Don’t be afraid to fail. Don’t let your failures determine you. Rise again. Keep moving

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Class is a community. There is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential. Unexcused absences (without a note from a doctor or agency) will affect your grade. 

Course material missed is your own responsibility to cover, make-up and address. It is not the Professor’s.

• One unexcused absence is allowed; After that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 points out of 100 for each additional unexcused absences.

• 3 unexcused absences is grounds for dismissal from the course.

• All presentation and critique days are mandatory.  Being absent on critique days, affects your grade for that project as well as your participation grade. Critiques can not be made up.

• Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not.

• Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. ([Slack](https://creativecodingfall18.slack.com) Direct message is preferred). Demonstrate time management, communication and respect.

• Be on time! Lateness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes you are late, your participation grade drops.

• Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Consult the syllabus. Consult Github for the demo code. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. Do these things first. It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.

• If you have some extenuating need to be outside of class (special doctor's appointment, religious observations, etc etc), please contact Judith Simonsen at (Js6244@nyu.edu, 646.997.3046). She is the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance. 

## Contacting Me
[Slack](https://creativecodingfall18.slack.com) Direct Message is the preferred initial contact. Otherwise you may email me (katherine.bennett@nyu.edu). Email is suitable for short questions (to answers that cannot be found in the syllabus), to set up appointments, or to notify me about being late or absent. Emails should not be longer than 5 sentences.

For matters longer than 5 sentences, please email me to make an appointment during office hours. This is the proper way to address longer questions, issues, to ask me about an assignment, review a grade you received, or to discuss other matters. If you send me a long email, I am simply going to respond by asking you to meet with me to resolve the matter. I will not resolve matters over email.

If I have asked you to schedule an appointment with me, I am not trying to avoid you. I am offering you my full attention and preparation. Due to my schedule and other campus responsibilities, I ask you to respond to emails and to be respectful of time.

## Course Structure
This is a hybrid course - lecture/demo, workshop, presentations and studio. Students will be required to read material and watch videos outside of and before class before coming to class to discuss the material. Class time will be devoted to questions, demos, in-class peer challenges, critiques and presentations. In addition to the reading and videos, students will be required to complete weekly assignments and demonstrate evidence of work through code. Students will work on individual projects and group collaborations. Guest critics may be present.

The course can be broken down into 3 sections throughout the semester: programming basics, Object Orientated Programming (OOP), and advance topics (automation/behaviors, using addons - JSON, API’s, Arduino, Computer Vision, Sound, etc).

A typical week will aim for the following schedule:

	• 7:00 - 7:15 Class Updates + Questions
	• 7:15 - 9:15 Demo/Lecture/Workshop/Discussion/Pair Programming Challenge
	• 9:15 - 9:40 Show & Tell Presentations
	• 9:40 - 9:50 Tickets to Leave

## Important Aspects of this Course

• **Pair programming** is a popular way to learn and to work on projects. Two people share one computer and write code together. For the second half of class, an exercise will be given which will be worked on in pairs. The exercise will be due at the end of the class period and presented to class. On occasions the deadline will be at another point. Yet, the exercise is meant to be worked on together - on one laptop, in one program. After the first couple of challenges, you will be paired up strategically by me. Each of you will have something to offer and something to gain. 

• **Homework will be submitted in one of two places, depending on the assignment. Sketch Exercises and In-Class Challenges will be turned in via [OpenProcessing.org](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/56532).** Use code BC5E to join our class site there. Projects (multi-week assignments) will be turned in via GitHub. GitHub is a web hosting service that supports Git version control. It is more important than your resume, whether you are an artist or designer. It’s used largerly for software, but can be used for anything. It’s important to become familar with it, develop good habits (it’s like Time Machine, but better). See the assigned reading links for more information.

• **Time** Time management is everything. You will need it to have reasonable accomplishments in this class. The material is cumulative. The readings are essential. Writing code is the only way to make progress and to fully synthesize the material. It becomes evident quite quickly. Develop excellent time management. You will need 8-12 hours outside of class to succeed. 

My personal favorite time management tools are [KanBan](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/), [Ink and Volt Planner](https://inkandvolt.com/product/volt-planner/) (also available in undated), the [Pomodoro technique](http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/)

• **Using code found elsewhere:** It's super easy to find code online. As tempting as this is, I am going to ask that you write your own code for the first 2/3 of the semester. This will help you grasp and retain the fundamentals. It does help to write the code from the book out, line by line. Code that is not written by you can not be submitted as a homework assignment, project or pair programming challenge as your own work. Period.

If you use code from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to site the work and author, as well as to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. Do *not* summarize several lines of code from a high level (ie, TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It's bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It's not a copy and paste job.

Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period.

If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assigment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

### How to Submit Assignments via GitHub


Do the follow these steps for each assignment:

	* 0. Save your work AND all of the necessary support files (index.html, libraries folder, pictures, media, etc) in a folder that is titled in this manner on your computer:
					*YourFirstNameYourLastName_P1*, etc.
	* 1. Go to your Github Repository page in a browser and create a new repo for the assignment, naming it Creative_Coding_Project_1

	* 2. Clone that repo to your desktop (it should launch the Github desktop app). Save that file in a folder on your computer for this class.

	* 3. Using a file browser (Windows Explorer, Finder, etc), take the folder created in step 0 and drop it INSIDE the folder you just created by cloning in step 2.

	* 4. Go back to the GitHub Desktop editor. In the summary field, write what additions you have made to your code in summary. In the description, add greater details, notes, and questions for me.

	* 5. Hit the "sync button" in the upper right hand corner. This uploads your code to your repo page on the Github website.

	* 6. Refresh your browser page of your repo. You should now see your code and files up on your repo

	* 7. As you continue to work on this project, save the code on your desktop, in the folder created in step 2. After saving each work session's progress, re-visit the Github desktop app to push the changes to your Github repo online. Make sure to fill out the summary and description notes. Do NOT and I repeat, DO NOT, make a new folder within this folder with the weeks editions. IE, you should not have "Week 1 work", "week 2 work", etc. Github tracks your changes and keeps them in history. It's version control! Yay!

## [Show and Tell](ShowAndTell.md)

You will be assigned a [Show and Tell presentation date here](ShowAndTell.md). Please research the assigned artist/designers/firms/pieces/collectives in advance. Each presentation will be about 5-7 minutes long. Be able to address the following, along with *3-4 visual examples of each individual or team's work*: 

• What is original/unique about how this artist uses technology? 

• What kind of code did the artist use?  (JavaScript? Flash? Procesing? openFrameworks? VVVV?) How are they using the code? What is the code achieving?

• Why is it necessary that the artist use code?  (ie: particularly if it’s non-interactive, could it have been achieved with traditional or linear media?)

• Your presentation must be prepared and professional. DO NOT USE TEXT ON YOUR SLIDES, other than the artist's/designer's/firm's names. Show. the. work. Discuss. the. work.

### Tips for your presentation

• Do not present to me. Look at your audience, your classmates. You are presenting to them.

• [THOUGHTS ON PUBLIC SPEAKING BY ZACH HOLMAN](http://speaking.io/) Click the links!!!

• Create a 5-7 minutes presentation (pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.)

• Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools - ie, notes)
Get familiar with your display preferences in advance!! I'm not kidding either. Borrow a cable from the student aids outside 811 by the kitchen area, and try it out on your own BEFORE class. Seriously. It makes all the difference in the quality of your presentation and presentation nerves.

• If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to Crestron. Test this out on the projector before your present. See above. 

• PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE. You will have to make presentations throughout your time here at NYU. Get comfortable with it and get better at it. I will be giving you feedback at times, about your ability to present and how to improve.

If you are fiddling around too much (and it's obvious you haven't tried this out before), I will ask you to sit down and present the following week after you've practiced. It's to respect class time.


## Grading

• Show & Tells			3%

• Self-Assessments (Tickets to Leave, Midterm & Final)		7%

• Participation 		5%

• In-class challenges   5%

• Sketches            15%

• Project 1: Adjective (critiqued)		15%

• Project 2: TBA (on-line critique)		15%

• RoundTable Presentation     5%  

• Final Project Milestone     5%  (either early or technical)

• Final Project: Choice (critiqued)			25%

For each project your grade will be assessed upon the following: *Principles, Creativity/Thoughtfulness, Craft*. Below gives you a sense of the spectrum, giving examples for high, middle and low grades.

Please note: 
A letter grade of "C" is an average grade. Average is not bad. It means average. Most of us are average, in some way. An average level of work is being done. It does not mean perfection. It means that the work still has room to develop at it's current state. It also means that the work has noticible achievements and evidence of some acquisition of knowledge. I look at this on an individual basis as well as across the whole class. 

Please read examples of each assessment point below to get an idea of my expectations. Note that a "B" is between Satisificatory and Superior.

### Principles:

• Superior - A - Your work shows evidence and understanding of programming concepts discussed in readings, lectures, and exercises, as you bend them to your will.

• Satisifactory - C - Your work shows evidence of concepts and is still developing an understanding of course material. You understand some aspects, but aren’t utilizing them fully. Usage is cursory. Keep pushing your work and review the material to revisit how you can integrate it to your work.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work shows some evidence of concepts discussed, but lacks key understanding, confidence, robustness and authority. Aspects are lacking. Reviewing course material is required. Ask questions in class. Manage your time better.

### Creativity, Thoughtfulness:

• Superior - A - Your work demonstrates your personality and a great depth of engagement with the material. It’s extremely evident that you are thinking, exploring, playing and taking risks. You are creating wonderful experiences.

• Satisifactory - C - You are executing your ideas, but more time is needed to consider more deeply about what is conceptually and physically happening. They are barely getting off the ground. Or have large bits that are broken. Do more research and exploring. Play.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work is so straightforward that it’s flat. It’s barely coded (or badly broken). It’s copied from elsewhere and not expanded upon. Question and Iterate your work to push your it further. Read. Play. Get off the lame track and get inspired.

### Craft:

• Superior - A - Your work shows delicate care and consideration to presentation and professionalism. You code is neat, clean, commented and structured. Your friends consider you “Type A.” Your style is evident.

• Satisifactory - C - Your work shows the birth of your ideas, but further time and iteration can really push your work to excel. Your code is there, but messy. It can be simplified and made cleaner. What you put into it, is what you get out of it. Practice makes perfect!

• Unexceptable - D/F - Your work is rushed and looks like it was done on your train-ride in or the night before. Make your work something you are proud of. You are here to build your portfolio after all, aren’t you?


## Participation will be based upon: Professionalism, Engagement, and Improvement

### Professionalism:

• Superior - A - Always arrives on time; assignments turned in properly and on time; respectful of others in class and gives feedback appropriately.

• Satisifactory - C - Usually arrives on time; most assignments turned in on time; listens to others.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Often tardy; turns in assignments late; fails to prepare for class; in attentive to instructor or other students

### Engagement:

• Superior - A - Always contributes appropriately to class discussion; frequently offers to demonstrate technique; shows leadership in group projects.

• Satisifactory - C - Usually contributes to class discussion; has demonstrated technique; participates actively in group projects.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Does not participate in class discussion; no evidence of technique; fails to contribute adequately to group projects. 

### Improvement:

• Superior - A - Shows an exceptional and growing understanding of technique; builds on previous lessons; accepts critique and makes proper adjustments.

• Satisifactory - C - Technique is developing; has shown some ability to build on previous lessons; generally able to accept critique.

• Unexceptable - D/F - Little or no development of technique; is unable or unwilling to accept critique; unable to make adjustments.

## Late Work
Unless specified, work is due the BEFORE following class period.

Work that is turned in after class but still on the due date get's 1/3 letter grade deduction. Work that is turned in the same week, get's 2/3 grade deduction. Subsequent submissions get one letter grade deduction for ever week that it is late, beyond the first week. The lowest possible grade a late assignment will be given, will be an "F". Deductions are calculated AFTER the initial grade is given.

If work is turned in beyond 4 weeks, the work must still meet the requirements for the assignment, or be an attempt in that direction. Work submitted beyond 4 weeks that does not make an attempt to meet the requirements will not be considered and a zero will be given for that assignment.

Assignments that are not submitted will receive a "0". Please realize that a "0" mark is a fantastic way to tank your grade. Getting an F (63%) is far better than getting a zero (0%).

## The numerical breakdown for letter grades is as follows:

• A	100-90		Excellent

• B	89-80		Very Good/Good

• C	79-70		Satisfactory

• D	69-63		Poor; Below Average

• F	63 & below	Unacceptable

## Technology in the Classroom

Be respectful of class time and activity. Our time together is limited. The experience is better for everyone in the class, if everyone can be present and active. It not only helps you, but it helps your neighrbor. Again, we live in a community and we must think beyond our own needs.

[Read Clay Shirky's thoughts on students & laptops in the classroom.](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.ong79i9mw)

## Academic Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html" target="_blank) in its entirety.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

This includes copying code for other sources, using code from other sources with only slight modifications and using code from other sources without a reference. See "Important Aspects to This Course" (above) and bullet point number 4 for greater elaboration on definition, requirements and expectations for utilizing code found elsewhere.

##  Educational Accessibility Statement

NYU-Tandon is committed to assuring equal educational opportunity and full participation for all students.  The mission of the Office for Students with Disabilities is to provide individuals with learning differences (a.ka. disabilities) the same access to programs and activities as other students.  We assist students to maximize their potential while helping them develop and maintain independence.

Students who believe they are eligible for course accommodations under the ADA or Section 504 or have had accommodations please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.
