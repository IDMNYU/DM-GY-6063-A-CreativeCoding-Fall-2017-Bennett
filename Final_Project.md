# DM-GY-6063-A Creative Coding
##### Spring 2017 • Katherine Bennett • Monday 19:00 - 21:50 


## Final Project: Choice   25% of your Final Grade
## Final Project Milestone <sup>1</sup>   5%  of your Final Grade

## Dates: 

### Working Prototype Due: December 11th
### Alpha Version Due: December 18th for inclass presentations

**Working Prototype:** All media should be gathered; basic functionality should be evident and working in your code. Code should be commented with pseudo code for future functionality.

**Beta Version:** Greater sophistication of your code should be evident along with interactivity/time elements/working API's/3rd Party Libraries (ie, physics engines, sound, animation, etc). Your code should be working. Bugs are present, but you've already squashed quite a few. Several things may still need to be worked out

**Alpha Version:** No bugs present. Smooth functionality to your code: interactivity, time, API's, smooth intergration with 3rd Party Libraries





_This is the culmination of this class. As a result, I expect you to not only demonstrate an understanding of concepts discussed this far, but a greater sophistication of them as well. In addition, your project should develop beyond the ideas discussed at the round table and your project should incorporate and include concepts discussed after week 8 (ie, string manipulation, 3rd party libraries, API's, vectors + forces, etc)._

_If you need assistance planning out your project stages, check out the resources section of Slack. I've uploaded a few designs to help layout tasks and manage time. If you need help figuring out what tasks to tackle first, please come hang out with me in my office hours. If you can't meet during that time, email me._

**Good Luck!**



<sup>1</sup> The Final Project Milestone is your choice of either of the following: a stellar working prototype that is quite advanced OR a technical achievement is present in your final version (or earlier push/version). A technical achievement is something that is _beyond_ what's covered in class directly - a concept, intergration of a 3rd Party library - something you've learned _independently_. List your resources (video's, forum posts, outside texts) and comment your code all the way.



#### Option 1- Persuasion
Choose a current event, news item, or issue that you feel strongly about and make a piece that addressees it.  Think of it as an interactive, algorithmic documentary.   The emphasis of this project is using code to be persuasive.  How can you convey a point of view in using procedural generation and interactivity?

Ingredients: Control structures, interaction, OOP, API's, addon’s, libraries, advance topics, change over time


#### Option 2 - High Score
Design and program a game. This project focuses on motion and interaction. To place the focus on those two components exclusively, the visual elements will be minimal. The visual components of the game are restricted to ~6 basic shapes on the screen at a time, but you may use any motion or interaction technique that you can imagine. You many use only lines, circles, and rectangles, but you may also use simple typography to keep score or show other basic data. These restrictions have been defined to minimize the complexity of the project, to encourage you to be creative within constraints, and to place the emphasis on the qualities of the interaction. After you have completed the game as geometry, you may choose to “skin” the game.

Ingredients: Control structures, interaction, OOP, API's, addon’s, libraries, advance topics, change over time


#### Option 3 - Interactive Narrative
Using a pre-existing narrative, or create your own, create an interactive narrative. Remember, that choice is paramount with interactivity. As a result, your story should have multiple paths to explore. This can be literal or it can be abstract. Experiment with time!

Ingredients: graphics, interactivity, image, video, sound, text, time structures, change, OOP, change over time


#### Option 4 - Choose your own adventure
Come up with your own idea, and describe it to us. Bring in examples, assests, and references of various Artists, Designers, Programmers, Games, Firms, Projects, etc. We do not exist in a vacuum. Make it crazy!
