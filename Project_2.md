Project 2: Collage and Manipulation

Text & Image 

Study chapters P3 & P4 in the Generative Design textbook. Using *text and image*, create a generative collage. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, generative means **_having the power or function of generating, originating, producing, or reproducing_**.

This collage should change over time, by user input or animation. This collage could be an interactive narrative non-linear or stop motion piece that tells a story. Be creative and experimental with this exercise.

Be expressive. You don't have to be literal. You are invited to be abstract.

It must be done in P5.js. You must use images and you must use text. Do not use sound. You may use graphics, but you are to mainly use image and text and to choreograph them over time.

I expect to see 2 pushes before the turning in the final. Submit pull requests throughout.
