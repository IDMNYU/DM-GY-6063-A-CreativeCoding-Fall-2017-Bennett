###P5.js transition + Functions with parameters




 1.) Take your first sketch - your monster - and translate it to the P5.js platform. Make sure that it functions in the browser properly!

 2.) Organize your monster into functions, utlizing variables and passing parameters. It's possible to nest functions inside other functions. For example, you could call fraggle(), and it would call other functions (ex, head, neck, tenacles, etc) that would individually contain their drawing elements.

 Matrix transformations can be quite handy here. Use variables for the x and y positions that are passed with the function call. Doing so will enable you to have multiples on the screen in varying locations.


 3.) Further organize those functions, into requiring variables for particular aspects that you wish to vary - width, height, color, variety, etc etc. 


 4.) Create 3 different monsters, with 3 calls to the same function. Pass different parameters in each call, to make each monster unique. There should be similarities and differences between them.


 **Bonus:** Create an array that stores different values for one variable. Ex. hair colors, # of appendages, # of eyes, etc. Use a for-loop to iterate through the array, passing the array's indice to a monster function call as a parameter.
