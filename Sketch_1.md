Sketch 1 Monster
			

Write a program that creates a monster. Use 5 different colors and 7 different shapes (minimum). Make them interesting! How is their personality visually evident? Get creative and have fun!

The more, the better. 

One way to interpret this is to think of different emotions that can be visually evident with multiple changes of the graphics. 

Use different shapes, colors, opacities, sizes, position, etc.
