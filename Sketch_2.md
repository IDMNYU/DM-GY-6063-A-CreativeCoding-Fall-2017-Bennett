### Sketch 2

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern

 This is a 2-part Sketch



Part 1:

 Using 1 form/shape and create 6 drastically different grid patterns. Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. Use a keyPress to switch between different patterns. As a result, all of your patterns should appear in one sketch

 - use active mode
 - use variables
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique, and to have variety


Part 2:

Once you have that pattern created, how can you use it as a drawing tool/instrument or send it values to animate it across space based upon an input? Can you create a loop, which creates your pattern? Can you then trigger that loop upon input? Can this sequence of events take in data, to make it slightly different over time? Another way to think about it, is different brush brisles can lay each of these patterns down, but at a slightly different location due to how the brush if configured.

Can you then create different brushes, each with a unique form/pattern. How many iterations of your pattern occur with one click or mouse movement? How does the size change? How does the space between the marks change? Can you make a spray can pattern? Does something happen to the mark once it's on the page? Does it bleed, spread, or blend with other colors on the page?

 - How could you incorporate random and/or interactivity to add variety + change? How could this be controlled over time?

 - Use your matrix transformations and for-loops
