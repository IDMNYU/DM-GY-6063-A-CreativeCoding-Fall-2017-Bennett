Project 2: Purple: Drawing Machine
Due Nov 27th


Make a drawing machine. This should be experimental, crafted and unknown. It should not be totally random and it should not be completely determined. Push color, shape, size, timing and frequency.

Your machine should:

- be visually evident, changing over time
- be interactive in some fashion with the mouse
- have the ability to clear or erase the screen
- use randomness in some interesting, yet crafted, way


If you wish to add sound, it cannot be a sound track. The sound must relate the visuals, whats happening with visuals and interaction in some way. It can't be thrown in over the top of the project. It must be interegrated and controlled (on-goingly) with code.

You're code should be superb, utilizing functions and OOP.
