# In-Class Challenge 3:


#### Create a super simple class that has the following in p5.js:


	• A constructor function which declares and sets a few global variables in the class, by passing parameters


	• A method to display the graphics (ie, what is it? Make a simple shape with various attributes and features)


	• A method to change variables associated for location. Use parameters to effect changes within the method



	• Then, after making the class, create two objects that are different instances of the class. Give them different attributes along with different locations.
