# In-Class Challenge 3:

#### Create a super simple class that has the following in p5.js:

	• A constructor function which declares and sets a few global variables in the class, by passing parameters

	• A method to display the graphics (ie, what is it? Make a simple shape with various attributes and features)

	• A method to change variables associated for location. Use parameters to effect changes within the method. We should be able to call this method, then the display method to simulate movement

	• Then, after making the class, create two objects that are different instances of the class. Give them different attributes along with different locations.

	• Call the various methods on the class to move and display it. We should be able to look at these objects moving.
